# MlClassification_models
Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.

## Overview to the Algorithms:
### Support Vector Machine:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.

### k-Nearest Neighbors:
KNN algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithm and it is one of the most used learning algorithms. So what is the KNN algorithm? I’m glad you asked! KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. Its purpose is to use a database in which the data points are separated into several classes to predict the classification of a new sample point.

### Random Forest Classifier:
A random forest consists of multiple random decision trees. Two types of randomnesses are built into the trees. First, each tree is built on a random sample from the original data. Second, at each tree node, a subset of features are randomly selected to generate the best split.

### Logistic regression:
It’s a classification algorithm, that is used where the response variable is categorical. The idea of Logistic Regression is to find a relationship between features and probability of particular outcome.
