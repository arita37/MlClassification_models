    "# Naive Bayes Classifiers\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.\n",
    "## Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. \n",
