    "# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "The stochastic gradient method is a gradient descent method optimized by the rate of convergence. The difference between the traditional gradient method is that the elements are considered separately. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approximate the gradient using only one data point. So, evaluating gradient saves a lot of time compared to summing over all data. This is very useful while specifically working with big data sets. Thus, the gradient of the cost function will be calculated not for all elements in the sample, as it is done with the traditional gradient descent method, but for each element separately. The gradient calculated for a particular element is taken as an approximation of the real gradient. Weights in the model are recalculated in accordance with the calculated gradient for one element, which leads to the fact that the model is adjusted when moving from each successive element of the sample to the next.\n",
